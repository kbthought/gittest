# Train the Trainer Post-test

### Activity 1

Using the **GitHub Flow**, complete the following tasks:

- Create an issue containing the steps for this activity as a task list.
- Using the existing `more-to-learn` branch, edit the `index.html` file as instructed within the file itself.
- When you finish, rebase the `more-to-learn` branch onto `master`.
- Push your changes to GitHub and open a pull request (be sure to add the syntax to close your issue with your PR).
- Mention the training team and then merge your PR.
- Once your PR has been merged, check out the `self-assessment` branch to find the instructions for activity 2.

### Reminders

- These activities use both GitHub.com and Git. Complete as many of the tasks locally as possible.
- The last activity will require you to paste your command line history for the entire activity.
